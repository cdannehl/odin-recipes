# odin-recipes
This project will be my first coding project.
I imagine it will be ugly and crude, but will work.
I'm hoping to demonstrate and retain the html knowledge I have gained so far on this course.
I know I'm a fast learner, and do well with IT related things, but lately I have been lacking the motivation to expand my education on my current career path and need a change. With resources avalible online like The Odin Project I feel like I can finally step into the industry without going into debt to do it. Wish I looked into programs like this sooner.
With all that being said I love problem solving and building things, so I am more than motivated and determined to learn all I can.
