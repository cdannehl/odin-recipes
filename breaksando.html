            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <strong>Poppy Seed Kaiser Rolls:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li>
                <li>In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the spiral attachment, add flour, amylase, salt, and sugar. Whisk to combine. Separately, whisk the yeast into your water until dissolved, then beat in egg until homogenous.</li>
                <li>Start your stand mixer onto medium low speed. Pour your yeast mixture into the flour mixture, let it mix until you get a rough dough, add butter, and knead until fully incorporated and your dough begins to pul from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. Next, take your dough from the stand mixer bowl onto a work surface and knead for 2 - 3 minutes or until you get a smooth dough.</li> 
                <li>Place in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and rise at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in size. Once your dough has doubled, punch it down, place onto a lightly floured work surface, and divide it into 6 even pieces (130g each). Roll each piece into a tight ball, and place onto a parchment lined baking sheet, evenly spaced apart.  Optionally using a kaiser mold, press down into the center of a dough ball ¾ of the way through, without puncturing to the bottom. Repeat with the remaining balls.</li>
                <li>Spray your balls lightly with cooking spray, flip your rolls over and cover with plastic wrap to proof for 25 min. Once proofed, flip your rolls back over and lightly brush each roll with whole milk. Sprinkle them with poppy seeds and bake in the oven for 15 - 18 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Traditional Bacon Egg and Cheese:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, crack in the eggs, season to taste with salt, and whisk until homogenous.</li>
                <li>Set a 12” nonstick pan over medium heat, add butter; once melted and bubbling, pour in about 2 whole eggs worth of your beaten eggs; as they cook, bring the sides to the center, letting the loose uncooked eggs fill the now open space in the pan. Repeat all the way around.</li>
                <li>Once the eggs are nearly cooked, add 2 slices of American cheese to the center, season with pepper next, fold the bottom side of the eggs towards the center, then the top side towards the center, then the right and left side, forming a rough enclosed square.</li>
                <li>Assembly.- Starting with your bottom bun, add your egg square and cooked bacon. Spread ketchup to taste on the top bun, season with fresh ground pepper. Top your sandwich, and wrap tightly in parchment paper, aluminum foil, or a sandwich wrapper. Cut in half and enjoy while warm. </li>
            </ol>
